# Tata Internship Project

Welcome to the Tata Internship Project repository! 
This repository contains the files and deliverables from my Tata Motors / Tata Internship where I completed real-world tasks, built dashboards, and presented data-driven insights.

## Overview

As part of the Tata Virtual Internship, I worked on a business analytics and data visualization project focused on deriving insights from a real dataset. The goal was to use data to answer business questions relevant to leadership teams such as the CEO and CMO, develop meaningful visuals, and communicate findings clearly.
